Hi, I'm Edison. I'm currently the Head of Engineering at Aqilliz, where I lead a group of talented engineers to build adtech solutions. Before that, I worked in Zilliqa where I helped to launch the mainnet. I've also built the first custody solution and security token platform for Zilliqa under the HG Exchange project.

I build stuffs related to blockchain, distributed systems and cryptography.
